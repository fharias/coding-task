# Task 2

## Implement a grid display for the list of movies [ x ]
The list of movies in the home page is currently displayed as a vertical list, convert it to a grid display. Write vanilla CSS for this. CSS preprocessors are allowed, but library solutions such as Bootstrap etc. are not.

## Implement a modal to display the Youtube player [ x ]
The youtube player is currently displayed above the list of movies, please turn it into a modal which appears when the user clicks “view trailer”, users should be able to close the modal and return to the movie list

## Implement infinite scrolling [ x ]
The movie list in home page and search results does not have the option to load more data, please extend its functionality with infinite scrolling capabilities, implementing your own HOC or hook in the solution is a bonus


# To do

- [x] Create a fade in animation for the infinite scrolling
- [ ] Improve the styling of the modal
